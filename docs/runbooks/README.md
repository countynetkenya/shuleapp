# Runbooks

This folder will hold short operational runbooks.

Examples to add:

- `runbooks/deploy.md` — steps for deploy to staging/production
- `runbooks/debug-session-failure.md` — common troubleshooting for session/cookie issues
- `runbooks/rollback.md` — quick rollback steps

For now: document local verification steps in feature docs when changes are made.
